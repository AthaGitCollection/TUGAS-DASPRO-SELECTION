2.1 LAB 1 Answer Question :

1. There are 3 main components in FOR loop. Based on experiment 1 above, identify and
explain these 3 components!

Answer : Initialization is used to initialize the loop control variable.
Example: int i = 1;

Condition determines whether the loop will continue to run or stop.
Example: i <= 50;

(Increment/Decrement) changes the value of the loop control variable after each iteration.
Example: i++;
 
2. Explain how the following code works!

Answer : The code checks numbers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.
If a number is a multiple of the input (i % multiple == 0), it adds that number to sum and increases counter by 1.
So, it counts and adds all multiples of the given number between 1 and 50.

3. Done
